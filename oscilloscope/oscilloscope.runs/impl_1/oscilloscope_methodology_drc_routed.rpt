LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell u_Driver_UART/inst/UART_Tx0/Tx_ACK_INST_0, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) u_UART_Send/FSM_sequential_Pulse_Init_Flag_reg[0]/CLR, u_UART_Send/FSM_sequential_Pulse_Init_Flag_reg[1]/CLR, u_UART_Send/Pulse_Init_Flag_reg[0]/CLR, u_UART_Send/Pulse_Init_Flag_reg[1]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell u_UART_Send/Tx_En_reg_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) u_UART_Send/Tx_En_reg_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert
